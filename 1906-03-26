PG 3 of my issue included a section of the "CARIO FLOWER SHOW". This advert came
 after the Element= Local and General but was
not included in the section. This advertisement talked about the weekend that
they had a flower show and the Khedive was there
along with princess' and princes. What I found to be interesting was that they
lacked what the flower show entailed, it was
mostly about what the Khedive did along with other important people that made
appearances. It failed to tell why they had this
flower show and what it was for, along with the setup of the arrangements and
only focused on whom seemed to be the important
ones who came to the flower show.  There is a whole paragraph on when and how
the Khedive arrived at the flower show, as I assume to many was important
considering he was king at the time.
The article also addressed the winners of the flower show and whom received What
ranking of places for their tables.
